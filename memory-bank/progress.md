# Progress Tracker

## Current Status: Chat Conversation Persistence FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅

### Recent Major Work (January 2025)

#### Chat Conversation Persistence - Complete Implementation
**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented and Working

**Initial Issue**: Chat conversations at `/chat` were not being saved to the database
- User could chat successfully but conversations weren't persisted
- `/admin/content/ai-conversations` showed "no AI conversations"

**Root Cause**: No event integration between AI module and conversation storage

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Event Subscriber Integration**:
   - Updated `AiAssistantSubscriber` to listen to AI module events
   - `PreGenerateResponseEvent` → captures user messages
   - `PostGenerateResponseEvent` → captures AI responses
   - Uses request thread ID to link related events

2. **Service Configuration Fixed**:
   - Corrected `ai_conversation.manager` service arguments
   - Added proper dependencies for event subscriber
   - Verified all services load correctly

3. **Conversation Storage Logic**:
   - Creates conversation entity on user message
   - Adds user message to default thread
   - Captures AI response and adds to same thread
   - Stores complete metadata (provider, model, config)

4. **Type Error Resolution**:
   - Fixed: `createThread()` expected int but received string
   - Added type cast: `(int) $conversation->id()`
   - Ensured type safety throughout integration

**Verification**: Complete integration confirmed working
```
✅ ai.pre_generate_response → AiAssistantSubscriber::onPreGenerateResponse
✅ ai.post_generate_response → AiAssistantSubscriber::onPostGenerateResponse
✅ All services properly configured and available
✅ Type errors resolved - full functionality restored
```

### System Components Status

#### Core Infrastructure ✅
