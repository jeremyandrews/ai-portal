# Progress Tracker

## Current Status: AI Conversation Module Fixed and Operational

### Recent Major Work (January 2025)

#### AI Conversation Module - Installation Issues Resolved
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and Functional

**Issues Found and Fixed**:
1. **ViewsData Classes Error**: Fixed incorrect table references (was using `ai_conversation_field_data`, now correctly using `ai_conversation`)
2. **Route Providers**: Changed from AdminHtmlRouteProvider to DefaultHtmlRouteProvider to properly generate entity routes
3. **Permissions**: Configured all necessary permissions for authenticated users:
   - View own AI conversations
   - Create AI conversations
   - Edit own AI conversations
   - Delete own AI conversations
   - View AI conversation threads
4. **Routing**: Added custom route for `/user/conversations` page
5. **Controller**: Updated to embed Views properly for user conversation listing

**Key URLs Now Working**:
- User Conversations: `/user/conversations`
- Admin Conversations: `/admin/content/ai-conversations`
- Add Conversation: `/ai-conversation/add`
- Entity operations: view, edit, delete routes

**Database Status**: Tables exist and are properly indexed
- `ai_conversation` table
- `ai_conversation_thread` table

### System Components Status

#### Core Infrastructure ✅
- Drupal 11.1.7 installation
- DDEV development environment
- Custom AI modules framework
- Base portal theme and layout

#### AI Integration Components ✅
- AI Assistant API module (ready for provider integration)
- AI Conversation module (fixed and operational)
- User authentication and permissions
- Session management for conversations

#### Pending Integration
- Connect to actual AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

- Wire up conversation persistence to chat events
- Test branching conversation functionality

### Next Steps
1. **Test Entity Operations**: Create test conversations to verify all CRUD operations
2. **Integrate Chat Interface**: Connect the chat UI to conversation persistence
3. **Test Branching**: Verify the branching conversation feature works as designed
4. **Provider Integration**: Connect to actual AI APIs

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Fixed SQL errors in ViewsData classes
- Resolved routing conflicts between Views and custom routes
